              Our Founder David has had a vision for the last 5 years to change
              the landscape of the mental health industry across the world. At
              Mindmap we believe that support for a personâ€™s mental health is
              more than a single instance of mindfulness but rather a continuous
              journey that encapsulates community, access and information
            </p>
            <p className="text-[12px] lg:text-[20px] py-3">
              Over the last year, we have been building and creating a solution
              that gives people the opportunity to go on that end of end journey
              and we look forward to releasing it in the future!
